          <p>The United States has become an increasingly tumultuous nation over 
                <br> the past few years and decades, with many social issues being brought 
                <br> to the forefront of public dialogue. Prominent amongst these issues is
                <br> police brutality. This visualisation will analyse police shootings over
                <br> the last 7 years, with a goal to identify if these shootings are associated
                <br> with  <span class="txt-bluebold">reasonable</span> or  <span class="txt-bluebold">unreasonable</span> factors. We will see how police 
                <br> shootings stack up by <span class="txt-bluebold">state, race, and crime statistics</span>

            <p>There is a notable drop in shootings around mid 2020. This is likely related to </p>
            <p>two events: the <span class="txt-bluebold">COVID pandemic</span>, and the much publicised and protested death of <span class="txt-bluebold">George Floyd.</span>
              <span class="bold">little correlation</span>The former meant that there was less reason for police to use force, since citizens were staying home more
            often, and the latter meant that police may have become apprehensive about using force moving forward, given the potential backlash.</p>
            <p>This chart to the left shows the relationship between each race as a percentage of the US population (gray) and as
              a percentage of the police shootings victims. It is clear from this visual that black people are overrepresented
              as victims of police shootings, year in and year out. This suggests that racism is potentially at play, however, there may be other variables
              which haven't been considered.</p>

          <p> The above statistics are somewhat concerning, as being unarmed, having a mental illness, showing no signs of attack, and not fleeing
          , are all things that the average person would presume creates a situation where lethal force is <span class="txt-bluebold">unnecessary</span>. Thus, we would have expected
          these percentages to be <span class="txt-bluebold"lower overall</span>.</p>
          <p> The chart on the right compares number of shootings, murder rate, total population and percentage of urban population for each state. From this,
          we can determine if high levels of shootings are correlated to the <span class="txt-bluebold">environment</span>, rather than to the <span class="txt-bluebold">individual case</span>. 
          It appears that no strong correlation is immediately visible, as one would have presumed. However, upon close examination, we can see that the number of shootings
          as a proportion of population seems to <span class="txt-bluebold">increase</span> across all measures, which is indeed what was expected.</p>
